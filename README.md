## FAQ

- ### What's with all the antennas?
- The antennas are useful for WiFi broadcast monitoring as well as BlueTooth broadcast monitoring. It's not important for all systems to have antennas, but the deal on them at the time was too good to pass up, so all systems recieved a dual antenna wireless adapter.
- TLDR: WiFi for all systems, Ubertooth One.
